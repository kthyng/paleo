Since the locations are defined on the u and v grid by the cell wall that the river water is actually exiting through, the proper grid labels are shown for each of the 3 main numerical grids.\n",

This file is referenced in time to 'days since 1970-01-01 00:00:00' and starts on 2010-01-01, though the date isn't relevant for this simulation except to keep track of time passing. The time length is controlled in this file (currently a year of 30 day months) and the output is every 3 hours. The river is input over the full 20 vertical layers. The amount of river water in each layer is weighted by the thickness of the layer so that the profile is uniform over the water column. There are 24 input locations that the river water is divided across at each time step, and the amount out each cell face is weight by the surface area of the cell wall.\n",
